= Highlight link based on current page in rails

This is common pattern in website navigation, where it highlights the link (usually by setting `class=”active”`) that took you to the current page while you are on that page.

First, define a helper:

```ruby
def is_active?(page_name)
  "active" if params[:action] == page_name
end
```

Then call it in your link\_to’s in your layout as such:

```ruby
link_to 'Home', '/', :class => is_active?("index")
link_to 'About', '/about', :class => is_active?("about")
link_to 'contact', '/contact', :class => is_active?("contact")
```

This effect is achieved due to how link_to handles being passed `nil` for its `:class`, so when \`is_active?`returns`nil`(because its not the current page),`link\_to`outputs nothing as its class (not`class=””\` as you might expect).
